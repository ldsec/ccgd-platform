# Citizen-Centered Genomic Discovery Platform
This repository contains the code and scripts needed to reproduce the experimental results reported in the article:
D. Grishin, J.L. Raisaro, J.R. Troncoso-Pastoriza, K. Obbad, K. Quinn, M. Misbach, J. Gollhart, J. Sa, J. Fellay, G. Church, J.P. Hubaux, "Citizen-Centered, Auditable, and Privacy-Preserving Population Genomics" (the full reference will be added when the paper is online).
The code is divided in two folders:
- Secure Discovery Tools
- Consent Management and Access Control Tools

## Secure Discovery
This is the code that corresponds to the privacy-conscious patient discovery tool, which uses and extends the core functionalities of the [MedCo framework](https://medco.epfl.ch). More information about the MedCo framework and codebase, and detailed steps for its deployment can be found at the [MedCo documentation](https://medco.epfl.ch/documentation/). Please refer to the readme in this directory for full instructions.

## Consent Management and Access Control Tools
This code demonstrates a form of blockchain-based consent management. Also includes instructions on how to locally spin-up an example blockchain and validator nodes, as well as the set of example API calls for this blockchain. Please refer to the readme in this directory for full instructions.
